**-> INTRODUCTION**

The world of commerce is constantly evolving and businesses must adapt to stay ahead of the curve. From predicting consumer trends to managing complex supply chains, businesses face endless challenges that require innovative solutions. In this regard, our major project in collaboration with Ernst & Young, a well-known multinational services company, has played an important role in developing software solutions to address some of these challenges.

Our projects focus on developing custom software solutions that enable companies to effectively address these challenges. These solutions can take the form of websites, machine learning applications, databases, programs, and more. The software solutions we develop are tailored to each company's specific needs. Our approach prioritizes ease of use, scalability, and reliability to ensure long-term value for our customers.

Together with Ernst & Young, we leverage our expertise in consulting and advisory services to identify key areas where our software solutions can have a meaningful impact. We work closely with their experts to understand your business needs, conduct in-depth research and analysis, and design software solutions that deliver measurable results. Through this partnership, we aim to develop cutting-edge software solutions that enable companies to thrive in today's rapidly changing business environment.

**-> GOAL**

The primary goal of this project is to develop a data hub for economic data all across the world. It would be accessible to all and would be driven by the collaborative effort of its community. This site is aimed particularly at users like students, researchers, scholars, stock market investors, and other stakeholders concerned in the economics of nation states.

The system is composed of a frontend built using the React.js framework and a backend supported by a Flask REST API server. Data is stored in an SQLite database.
The system aims at offering a realistic and feasible solution by providing an economic data hub that can be accessed as well as managed by all. It adopts the idea of a community to sustain itself, where the community provides for itself and is also accountable to itself.

**-> DEVELOPMENT**

The application can be broadly classified into the client (frontend) and server (backend). The client was developed using the React.js framework – a popular JS framework used for developing single page apps (SPAs). On the other hand, the server (REST API) was deployed using the Flask framework. Data is stored and managed using an SQLite database.

On the server, a number of support libraries were used to build the REST API. User-identity management is handled with the help of JWTs. Flask support for JWT is available in the form of many libraries, however, many of these libraries do not receive proper maintenance and are not well documented.

The React app uses Bootstrap for styling. Bootstrap was chosen for its mobile-first approach and for its pure simplicity. Tailwind was considered, however, it was concluded that its impressive versatility would be largely unused.

Hosting the application’s source in a GitHub repository made it possible to collaborate and work on the project remotely. GitHub offers various other features as well such as raising issues, reviewing pull requests, managing deployments, installing plugins and so on. With the source publicly available on the repository, it is possible to host the application through third party cloud providers such as Vercel, Heroku, Firebase and AWS.

The tools used can be summarized into the list provided below.

- React.js
- Flask
- Bootstrap
- MySQL
- VS Code (Editor)
- GitHub (Collaboration, Code Repository)
